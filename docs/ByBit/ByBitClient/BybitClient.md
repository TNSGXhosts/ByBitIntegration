# BybitClient

`BybitClient` is the concrete implementation of `IBybitClient`. It wraps the underlying services provided by **bybit.net.api** to access Bybit v5 endpoints. The client exposes three high level asynchronous methods and is configured through `BybitSettings`.

## Construction
```csharp
var client = new BybitClient(IOptions<BybitSettings> settings);
```
The constructor expects API credentials and whether the testnet should be used. It internally creates instances of:
- `BybitMarketDataService` – retrieves public market data.
- `BybitTradeService` – submits trading orders.
- `BybitAccountService` – queries account information.
All requests are sent to the testnet URL by default (`https://api-testnet.bybit.com`).

## Methods
### GetKlinesAsync
```csharp
Task<List<Kline>> GetKlinesAsync(string symbol, MarketInterval interval, int? limit = null);
```
Fetches historical candlestick data for a symbol. The result is converted into the domain `Kline` model via `KlineListConverter`.

### PlaceOrderAsync
```csharp
Task<PlaceOrderResult> PlaceOrderAsync(string symbol, Side side, OrderType orderType, decimal qty);
```
Sends a spot order to Bybit. The method returns `PlaceOrderResult` containing identifiers generated by the exchange.

### GetWalletBalanceAsync
```csharp
Task<IEnumerable<WalletBalance>> GetWalletBalanceAsync(AccountType accountType);
```
Retrieves account balances for the unified account. On success the method returns a collection of `WalletBalance` objects.
